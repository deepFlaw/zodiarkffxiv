### Built With

* [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Have python installed (if you want to use the provided python server), or have any other web server set up. That's because Phaser won't work unless the files are served over http, so simply opening the html file in a browser won't work.

### Installation

1. From the root directory, run 
	```
	python server.py
	```
2. Browse to http://127.0.0.1:8080
